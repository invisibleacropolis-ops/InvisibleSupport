2. Define cohesive design tokens and reusable utility classes.
3. Ensure responsive behavior and immersive background support.
4. Document final state and run applicable checks.

### TODOs
- [ ] Implement portal markup with upload focus.
- [ ] Add global styles and utility classes.
- [ ] Validate responsiveness and accessibility considerations.
- [ ] Summarize updates and finalize log entry.
