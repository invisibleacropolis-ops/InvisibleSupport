# Web Development Log

## Session 2024-06-10 Start
- Initialized workspace review.
- Identified requirement to create `index.html` and establish design system.

### Plan
1. Draft HTML structure with two-column layout prioritizing upload workflow.
2. Define cohesive design tokens and reusable utility classes.
3. Ensure responsive behavior and immersive background support.
4. Document final state and run applicable checks.

### TODOs
- [ ] Implement portal markup with upload focus.
- [ ] Add global styles and utility classes.
- [ ] Validate responsiveness and accessibility considerations.
- [ ] Summarize updates and finalize log entry.

## Session 2024-06-10 End
- Created immersive upload-focused `index.html` with responsive two-column layout and reusable utilities.
- Documented design tokens, components, and copy workflow enhancements.

### Completed TODOs
- [x] Implement portal markup with upload focus.
- [x] Add global styles and utility classes.
- [x] Validate responsiveness and accessibility considerations.
- [x] Summarize updates and finalize log entry.

### Next Session Plan
1. Integrate actual upload logic and connect to backend APIs.
2. Flesh out tab interactions and library data bindings.
3. Add automated tests or linters once tooling is defined.

## Session 2024-06-11 Start
- Reviewed Document Management requirements and existing layout.
- Established plan for implementing upload workflow, persistence, and UI rendering updates.

### Plan
1. Enhance upload form with validation, metadata capture, and progress state.
2. Implement storage module using Blob URLs and localStorage serialization.
3. Build library table with filtering, actions, and event-driven re-rendering.
4. Integrate document viewer pane with copy/open controls and fallback messaging.

### TODOs
- [ ] Implement enhanced upload form and validation feedback.
- [ ] Persist documents with metadata and Blob URL caching.
- [ ] Render library list with search/filter and action controls.
- [ ] Implement viewer pane with controls and fallback messaging.
- [ ] Document changes, run tests, and finalize session notes.

## Session 2024-06-11 End
- Implemented client-side Document Management module with persistent library and viewer experience.
- Validated upload flows with drag/drop, paste, and metadata capture including progress feedback.

### Completed TODOs
- [x] Implement enhanced upload form and validation feedback.
- [x] Persist documents with metadata and Blob URL caching.
- [x] Render library list with search/filter and action controls.
- [x] Implement viewer pane with controls and fallback messaging.
- [x] Document changes, run tests, and finalize session notes.

### Next Session Plan
1. Add bulk action controls (multi-select delete/share) for the document library.
2. Integrate offline/online state indicators and reconciliation for large files.
3. Explore automated UI regression capture for viewer and upload flows.

## Session 2024-06-12 Start
- Reviewed request to enhance base layout scrolling and implement dedicated Image Management module.
- Outlined alignment with existing document workflow while extending for image-specific capabilities.

### Plan
1. Enable predictable scrolling on the index page to surface full-height layouts.
2. Design and style image upload, gallery, and viewer components with responsive behavior.
3. Implement client-side image store with validation, EXIF parsing, and blob URL management.
4. Build gallery rendering logic supporting grid/list toggles, lazy loading, and preview selection.
5. Mirror document direct-link, copy, and metadata patterns for images.

### TODOs
- [ ] Add explicit scrollbar styling/behavior to the index page.
- [ ] Create image upload form with MIME/dimension validation and preview feedback.
- [ ] Persist images with metadata including EXIF when available.
- [ ] Render gallery in grid/list views with lazy-loaded thumbnails.
- [ ] Implement image viewer with fit/zoom controls and direct-link copy field.
- [ ] Document work, run checks, and close session log entry.

## Session 2024-06-12 End
- Added explicit scrollbar styling for consistent page navigation and visibility of extended layouts.
- Delivered Image Management module with validated uploads, persistent storage, gallery toggles, lazy thumbnails, EXIF parsing, and zoomable previews.

### Completed TODOs
- [x] Add explicit scrollbar styling/behavior to the index page.
- [x] Create image upload form with MIME/dimension validation and preview feedback.
- [x] Persist images with metadata including EXIF when available.
- [x] Render gallery in grid/list views with lazy-loaded thumbnails.
- [x] Implement image viewer with fit/zoom controls and direct-link copy field.
- [x] Document work, run checks, and close session log entry.

### Next Session Plan
1. Introduce bulk actions (multi-select delete/download) to accelerate media management.
2. Surface image tagging and filtering capabilities leveraging EXIF facets (camera, lens, ISO).
3. Explore offline caching strategies for frequently referenced thumbnails and previews.
